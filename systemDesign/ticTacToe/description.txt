The task is to replicate the tic-tac-toe game.

Google tic-tac-toe game has these features:
1) Player can change difficulty level or choose to play with a friend
2) Player can choose the side to play
3) We have points counter for both sides: X and Y

The first thing we need to think about is UI - easiest part: the main thing is that each square must have an ID
to be able to check if it's filled or not

The second thing is styles - nothing special about it

The next thing is scripts.
1) The first thing is to add event listeners on each square to handle the square fill and some state to see
who should do the turn.
2) We need to define win/lose and draw conditions and how to set points for each side.
3) By this point the PvP mode should be ready.
4) Then we need to define if player chosen to play against AI and only in that case activate next steps.
    4a) We need to think about what algorithm to use on each difficulty level. I suggest the next algorithms:
        4aa) on easy difficulty level AI should choose random square and fill it;
        4ab) on medium difficulty level AI should choose random square and fill it, but on each turn it should for the
        first player opportunity to win and block it (doesn't matter if the player have 2 opportunities).
        4ac) implement full minimax algorithm and it's practically unbeatable (you can read about it here
        https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37/ )

    4b) by the result of choosing algorithm we should fill the square and wait for the next turn
    (when the turn state will be 'AI' again)
5) if win/lose/draw conditions are met, we need to finish the game and return some kind of message
